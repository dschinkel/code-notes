    - Scrum is the most popular of all the Agile methods. Tens of thousands of people have been certified as Scrum Masters. Thousands of projects have use Scrum to get great work done. But there's a problem. Some of those projects fail, and fail badly. The reason they fail is that Scrum forgot something. Scrum forgot to incorporate the technical disciplines that make Agile work

     - Technical Debt has become a catch-all phrase for any code that needs to be re-worked. Much like Refactoring has become a catch-all phrase for any activity that involves changing code.
       These fundamental misunderstandings and comfortable yet mis-applied metaphors have resulted in a plethora of poor decisions. What is technical debt? What is not technical debt? Why should we care? What is the cost of misunderstanding? What do we do about it? Doc discusses the origins of the metaphor, what it means today, and how we properly identify and manage technical debt.

### Transformation Priority Premise
TPP suggests that Refactorings have counterparts called Transformations. Refactorings are simple operations that change the structure of code without changing it’s behavior. Transformations are simple operations that change the behavior of code. Transformations can be used as the sole means for passing the currently failing test in the red/green/refactor cycle. Transformations have a priority, or a preferred ordering, which if maintained, by the ordering of the tests, will prevent impasses, or long outages in the red/green/refactor cycle.

### TDD as if you mean it
**Preface**: [TDD as if you mean it](https://gojko.net/2009/02/27/thought-provoking-tdd-exercise-at-the-software-craftsmanship-conference/) was invented by a guy named [Keith Braithwaite](http://peripateticaxiom.blogspot.com/) in London during the Software Craftsmanship Conference 2009.  His idea is that you can write code with TDD in a way that forces you to make very small steps.  This means you need to respect the following rules:
1. write exactly ONE failing test
2. make the test from (1) pass by first writing implementation code IN THE TEST
3. create a new implementation method/function by:
    - doing extract method on implementation code created as per (2), or
    - moving implementation code as per (2) into an existing implementation method
4. only ever create new methods IN THE TEST CLASS
5. only ever create implementation classes to provide a destination for extracting a method created as per (4)
6. populate implementation classes by doing move method from a test class into them
7. refactor as required
8. go to (1)
