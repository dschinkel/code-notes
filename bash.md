# Oh My Zsh
- I use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) which provides a [ton of nice git aliases](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Cheatsheet) that make you a lot quicker when typing git commands.  I highly recommend it.
# Bash
**meta** - your `Alt` key, normally. You need to enable it yourself usually in your terminal settings

- `env` - get a list of environment variables in os x
- `clear` - clear everything in terminal
- `history` - list history of commands you've made
- `arrow up`, `arrow down` - cycle through your command history
- `ctrl + c` exist command
- how to set your `option` key as "meta":
    - for **OS X built-in terminal** open it and then go to Edit | Use Option as Meta Key
    - for **iTerm2** go to _Preferences->Profiles_ tab. Select your profile on the left, and then open the Keys tab. Set the option key to use `Esc+`
- `fn + arrow left` or `Ctrl + e`, - jump to beginning of line
- `fn + arrow right` or `Ctrl + a` or  - jump to end of line
- `alt + f`, `alt + b` - move cursor backwards or forwards by words
- `Ctrl + b` - move backwards by chars
- `Ctrl + f` - move forwards by chars
- `meta + f` - move forward one word
- `meta + b` - move backward one word
- `Ctrl + u` - clear everything before cursor position
- `Ctrl + k` - clear everything after cursor position
- `Ctrl + d` - delete current char
- `Ctrl + w` - delete a word in front of cursor
- `Ctrl + r` - quick search commands you've done

**other**
- cal - see calendar and day

**Files - Editing, Saving, etc.**
- `esc` (gets you out of edit mode)
- `:wq` (saves the file)
