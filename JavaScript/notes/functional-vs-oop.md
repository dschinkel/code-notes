## Programming
- In all programs, there are two primary components: the data (the stuff a program knows) and the behaviors
## OOP
- You call function ***on** the object* and do stuff
#### Examples


## Functional
- the code is essentially a combination of functions
- functions operate on well-defined data structures, rather than belonging to the data structures
- you can pass around functions (as args) and return them
- there is no inheritance.  uses the JS prototype chain
- In functional code, a function is not able to change the outside world, and the output value depends only on the given arguments. This allows to keep strong control over the program flow
- JS can be used as a FP language as long as you take care of side effects, there is no builtin mechanism for that
